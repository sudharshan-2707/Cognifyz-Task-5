ðŸš€ Task 5: API Integration and Front-End Interaction

Iâ€™m thrilled to share my progress on Cognifyz Task-5! This challenge allowed me to focus on enhancing the server-client communication, providing a dynamic user experience through seamless API integration. Here's what I accomplished:

âœ… Server-Client Communication: Developed a robust RESTful API to handle CRUD operations on the server, enabling efficient data management.

âœ… Dynamic Front-End Interface: Built a user-friendly front-end interface that interacts smoothly with the API, ensuring a seamless data exchange experience.

âœ… Real-Time Data Fetching: Implemented data fetching from the server and dynamically displayed it on the front end, improving interactivity and responsiveness.
